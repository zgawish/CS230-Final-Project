# Predicting Monkey Arm Movememnts via Electrode Signals

Prosthetic limbs have allowed some patients to recover the majority of the function of the original limb. Medical providers utilize these artificial limbs for patients who either lost a limb in an accident or were born without a limb. However, this use case does not completely extend to those who are paralyzed, as artificial limbs cannot currently move on their own through brain signals. In this project, we explore this possibility by utilizing neural network models to predict the direction of a monkey's arm movement using electrode time series data. Our long short-term memory (LSTM) model scores a maximum accuracy of 20.13\% with only 506 data points, leading to the conclusion that more data is needed to properly train a LSTM model with such requirements and thus that this domain is especially difficult to apply deep learning models. However, since the accuracy is above a guessing accuracy of 12.5\%, we believe that it is possible to use our model to accurately predict such movements. Our baseline model, which we improved after gaining insight and intuition from our LSTM model, had a final accuracy of 42.2\%. We believe that this shows that our smaller dataset works better on simpler models, but the overall problem would be better suited for an LSTM given we had a larger dataset.
